My name is Amy Kamin, and I am a third-year Digital Humanities major currently living in Chicago, Illinois.  As a child, my family and I moved around quite a bit, and I ended up needing to adapt and make new friends quickly each time we settled into a new community.  It is something that, while difficult at the time, I have learned to appreciate about my life, as it taught me patience, kindness, and resiliance.  Also, for ten years I was an only child to my parents, as well as the only child in my extended family.  It was tough not having children to play with outside of my limited friend circle, however I learned to occupy myself and get creative when it came to my own entertainment.  I feel like these skills have transferred well into my adult life, and have the potential to propell me forward in my scholastic endeavors as well as my career.
