<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Amy Kamin, and I am a third-year Digital Humanities major currently living in Chicago, Illinois.  As a child, my family and I moved around quite a bit, and I ended up needing to adapt and make new friends quickly each time we settled into a new community.  It is something that, while difficult at the time, I have learned to appreciate about my life, as it taught me patience, kindness, respect, and resiliance.  Also, for ten years I was an only child to my parents, as well as the only child in my extended family.  It was tough not having children to play with outside of my limited friend circle, however I learned to occupy myself and get creative when it came to my own entertainment.  I feel like these skills have transferred well into my adult life, and have the potential to propell me forward in my scholastic endeavors as well as my career.

My post-secondary education has evolved over what some might consider a great amount of time.  In 2003, I graduated high school and was accepted into Loyola University Chicago, however, I could not complete classes due to a number of personal issues and had to withdraw.  I remained in Chicago though, and found a full-time working position as a temporary file clerk.  This position provided a number of connections that led me to my next position as a receptionist at a law firm downtown.  However, being young, I took poor advantage of this opportunity and ended up getting myself fired (the first and last time I would let this happen).  With my financial state in ruins, I moved back home with my parents and began to regroup: I enrolled in a local community college to study physics and worked to save money so I could move back to Chicago.  Which I did, in 2010.  After working full-time for a few more years and slowly completing more college coursework, I eventually gained enough insight to push me in a new direction: out of the workforce and into academia proper to study digital humanities at Illinois Tech.
</p>
<p>
Success at Illinois Tech depends on my continued desire to learn while working full-time, and my ability to recall why I wanted to study the humanities in the first place.  I believe the magic of cultural understanding has the ability to transcend differences between people and solve world problems.  The propensity for literature, art, philosophy, and music to reach beyond limited personal experience in order to touch our common humanity is essential to our species' function and growth.  This connection must continue to be explored.  By studying digital humanities, I am attempting to take advantage of modern digital tools that will help me express my interest in spreading cultural connections throughout the world.  I intend to focus on establishing cultural awareness within an educatonal context, and am looking forward to IIT providing the skills for me to do so.

My goals for this class, Standards-Based Web Design, align almost directly with my ultimate career goals.  In order to meet my career goal of utilizing my humanities knowledge to develop programs for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) systems within an educational or cultural setting, I will need to have a certain amount of programming skill.  In this class, I intend to use my understanding of git, HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS to create a portfolio website that will accompany my resume.  I also intend to learn how to build 3D environments for use in AR and VR, but will probably need to take courses outside of IIT.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am involved in research for faculty at the school, and I hope to eventually use that as a launching point for much of my future research on programming learning tools.  As I continue to learn more about what digital humanities major has the capability to teach me, I expect my interests and goals to fluctuate over time.  However, my ultimate goal will always be the same: to bring culture to those without access, and to establish community connections in an increasingly globalized world.
